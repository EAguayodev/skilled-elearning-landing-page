To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <picture>
          <source srcset="assets/image-hero-desktop.png 1400w,
          assets/image-hero-desktop@2X.png 1200w," 
          media="(max-width: 1440px) and (min-width: 1200px)">

          assets/image-hero-tablet@2X.png 1000w, 
          assets/image-hero-tablet.webp 900w, 
          assets/image-hero-tablet@2X.webp 800w" 
          media="(max-width:1023px) and (min-width: 767px)">
          <source srcset="assets/image-hero-mobile.png 767w, 
          assets/image-hero-mobile@2X.png 600w, 
          assets/image-hero-mobile.webp 500w,

      </picture>
```
```css

  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) - This site helped me with understanding which browsers had the strongest support for the picture tag.

- [webdesign.tutsplus](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand when to approach making an image responsive with img tag included with sizes and srcset, and when to use the approach of the picture tag with the img, srcset, and media included inside the source tag inside the picture tag element.
